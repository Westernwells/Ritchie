Thats all the files i could push 
thanks in advance bro
and again the axios was not working so i wanted to parse the html to nodejs but not working 
but you go see everything, node nah server hn dey nah why 

Try read on template engine it is used while doing server side rendering
i used ejs but are lot of other ones out there.

You will noticed that i have created a folder called view => pages, that is where you template filles lives in.

try use a DB for saving the reigistration details after saving successfully render the success page.

when building your admin page the template engine will be very handy.

all the best Bossman
